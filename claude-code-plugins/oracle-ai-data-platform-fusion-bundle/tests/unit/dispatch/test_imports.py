"""P1.5ε §Step 6b — dispatch import-boundary regression test.

Asserts the §4.3 separation: ``import dispatch`` MUST NOT pull
``orchestrator/*``, ``extractors/*``, ``dimensions/*``, or ``transforms/*``
into ``sys.modules``. Crossing this boundary means:

- The dispatch package can never accidentally couple to engine internals.
- A future MCP / Airflow dispatcher can slot in as a sibling under
  ``dispatch/`` without code surgery.
- P1.17's incremental MERGE rework can ship without touching dispatch.

Permitted schema-level imports (these are the explicit cross-boundary
modules):

- ``schema.bundle`` (AidpConfig, EnvSpec, Bundle, load_bundle)
- ``schema.errors`` (OrchestratorConfigError + cross-boundary subclasses)
- ``schema.refs`` (env-var rendering)
- ``schema.run_summary`` (RunStep, RunSummary, PlanNode, PrereqNode, marker serializers)
- ``schema.plan_resolver`` (P1.5ε-fix9 — dry-run plan resolver consumed by
  ``dispatch.dispatch_via_rest`` under ``--dry-run``)
