"""Orchestrator exception classes.

Single home for every error class the orchestrator raises, separated from
``runtime.py`` to avoid an import cycle: ``runtime.py`` defines RunStep
factories that take spec types from ``registry.py``; ``registry.py`` defines
resolvers that raise ``MissingDependencyError``. Both modules import
``errors.py`` and neither imports the other transitively.

All user-facing config / pre-dispatch errors inherit from
``OrchestratorConfigError`` so the CLI exit-2 path catches them all via a
single marker. Adding a new error class should not require another CLI
``except`` clause.

Cross-boundary classes (``OrchestratorConfigError``, ``BundleLoadError``,
``BundleVersionMismatchError``, ``MissingDependencyError``) live in
:mod:`oracle_ai_data_platform_fusion_bundle.schema.errors` so schema-level
loading, plan resolution, and dispatch code can raise and catch them without
importing the orchestrator engine. The names are re-exported here for
backwards compatibility; identity is preserved
(``orchestrator.errors.BundleLoadError is schema.errors.BundleLoadError``).

        strict-abort cascade then skips all remaining steps in the same run.
        ``commands/run.py``
        returns **exit code 1** for the resulting "any failed step"
        run summary. The full conflict list is durably captured in

      - **Raised before** ``orchestrator.run()`` **returns** (i.e.,
