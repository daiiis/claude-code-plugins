"""Regression — seed-mode bronze write must use overwriteSchema=true.

Per CLAUDE.md medallion invariant: ``CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE is for seed mode only``.
The bronze adapter's seed-mode write must include ``.option("overwriteSchema", "true")``
so a re-run can land on a target with a divergent prior schema (e.g. stale audit
columns from a half-completed run).

Caught live by TC26 probe ``run_id=023482f5-a613-4c62-8bed-b0b238c944f4``: Delta
threw ``[DELTA_FAILED_TO_MERGE_FIELDS] Failed to merge fields "_watermark_used"
and "_watermark_used"`` on the second seed-mode call against a table created by
an earlier extractors.bicc-attribute-error run.

Phase 9 follow-up: the v1 bronze write at ``orchestrator/__init__.py:289`` was
deleted along with ``_execute_node``. The invariant lives in the content-pack
bronze adapter (``orchestrator/builtins/bronze_extract_adapter.py``).
