"""Bundle orchestrator: DAG, state, run loop. Public surface = ``run()``.

This module owns:
  - ``run()`` — the public entry point.
  - ``_dispatch_content_pack_run()`` — content-pack runner orchestration
    (load pack → resume hydrate → PVO drift gate → per-node dispatch).
  - ``_run_content_pack_backend()`` — the per-node loop that fans into
    ``sql_runner.execute_node`` for every silver/gold/bronze node.
  - ``_bootstrap_spark()`` — sentinel-typed Spark session bootstrapper.

Modules ``runtime`` / ``state`` / ``errors`` are imports. The v1
``_execute_node`` dispatcher + ``Spec`` dataclasses were deleted in the
ADR-0022 cleanup.

    """Build the payload-diff predicate for a bronze MERGE's WHEN MATCHED clause.

    Bronze incremental MERGE under V1 used unconditional
    ``WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *``, which rewrites every matched row's
    ``_extract_ts`` on every cycle. For PVOs flagged ``incremental_capable=False``
    (full re-extract every cycle — ``gl_period_balances``, ``gl_coa``,
    ``ap_aging_periods``), the rewritten ``_extract_ts`` propagates downstream:
    silver/gold's ``WHERE bronze_extract_ts > <prior_silver_watermark>`` source
    predicate matches every row, forcing silver/gold MERGE to run unconditionally
    even when nothing materially changed.

    This helper builds the predicate that gates the UPDATE: an OR-joined
    ``IS DISTINCT FROM`` clause across every non-audit DATA column. When no
    payload column has changed for a matched row, the predicate evaluates
    ``false``, the UPDATE is suppressed, ``_extract_ts`` is NOT rewritten,
    and downstream silver/gold MERGE source filters match zero rows.

    Why ``IS DISTINCT FROM`` instead of ``<>``: Spark's ``<>`` is NULL-unsafe
    (``NULL <> NULL`` → NULL, treated as false in a WHEN clause). Bronze data
    often carries NULLs in optional columns (e.g., ``gl_period_balances``'s
    ``BalanceTranslatedFlag``). ``IS DISTINCT FROM``
    is the NULL-safe inequality: ``NULL IS DISTINCT FROM NULL`` → false;
    ``NULL IS DISTINCT FROM 1`` → true. Mirrors the NULL-safe ``<=>`` used
    in :func:`_natural_key_join_sql` — the two helpers have a coherent
    NULL-handling story.

    Why audit columns are excluded: ``_extract_ts`` and ``_run_id`` carry
    this run's literal values, which always differ from the prior run's
    literals — including them in the diff would force every cycle's UPDATE,
    defeating the whole optimization. ``_source_pvo`` and ``_watermark_used``
    are similarly cycle-constant or cycle-distinct and contribute nothing
    useful to a diff. The four are excluded by symbolic reference to
    :data:`BRONZE_AUDIT_COLUMNS`.

    Natural-key columns are included in the predicate even though, on a
    matched row (where the ON predicate matched), the natural-key columns
    are by construction NULL-safe-equal between target and src. The
    ``target.k IS DISTINCT FROM src.k`` clause evaluates ``false`` for those
    columns; their inclusion is harmless and keeps this helper decoupled
    from the node YAML (it doesn't need to know the natural key).

    Args:
        data_columns: An iterable of bronze schema column names — typically
            ``df.schema.names`` of the source DataFrame after audit-column
            enrichment.
        target_alias: SQL alias of the MERGE target. Defaults to ``"target"``.
        src_alias: SQL alias of the MERGE source. Defaults to ``"src"``.

    Returns:
        The OR-joined ``IS DISTINCT FROM`` predicate, or ``None`` if no data
        column remains after excluding :data:`BRONZE_AUDIT_COLUMNS`. ``None``
        signals the caller to fall back to the V1 unconditional ``UPDATE SET *``
        shape — defensive against a malformed bronze schema that wouldn't
        reach this code in practice.

    Examples:
        >>> _payload_diff_predicate_sql(["SEGMENT1", "VENDORID", "_extract_ts"])
        'target.SEGMENT1 IS DISTINCT FROM src.SEGMENT1 OR target.VENDORID IS DISTINCT FROM src.VENDORID'
        >>> _payload_diff_predicate_sql(["_extract_ts", "_source_pvo"])
        # → None  (all columns are audit; caller falls back to V1 shape)
    """

    ``bundle.datasets[]`` is the operator's high-level
    intent list. It can reference bronze / silver / gold ids; implicit
    transitive include pulls dependencies. Two legacy bundle fields —
    ``bundle.dimensions.build`` and ``bundle.gold.marts`` — pre-date the
    cross-layer ``datasets[]`` contract; when the YAML actually carries
    those blocks they fold into the scope so old bundles keep working.

    **Presence-aware**: the Pydantic schema ships non-empty defaults for
    ``dimensions.build`` (``dim_supplier``, ``dim_account``,
    ``dim_calendar``, ``dim_org``) and ``gold.marts`` (``ar_aging``,
    ``ap_aging``, ``gl_balance``, ``po_backlog``). A bundle that
    omits the blocks entirely would otherwise have those default ids
    smuggled into the scope. The check uses ``bundle.model_fields_set``
    — Pydantic's "fields the constructor was given" record — to fold
    only when the YAML actually authored the block. An author who
    explicitly writes ``dimensions: { build: [] }`` (or a non-empty
    list) marks ``dimensions`` as set and the inner ``build`` list is
    honored regardless of contents.

    Disabled datasets (``DatasetSpec.enabled = False``) are excluded —
    same contract the legacy resolver honored.

    Returns the SET of declared root ids. The resolver consumes this
    as ``bundle_scope=`` and:
      * Uses it as the implicit root set when no CLI ``--datasets``
        filter is given (so a no-filter run executes only declared
        roots plus transitive dependencies, NOT every pack node).

    primitive ``preflight_bronze_schemas`` (no row transfer), loads the
    pinned per-dataset snapshot if present, then hands the pair off to
    ``assert_fusion_pvo_compatibility``.

    Args:
        bundle: loaded ``Bundle``.
        bundle_path: path to ``bundle.yaml`` (used to resolve the
            snapshot file under ``profiles/``).
        spark: caller-supplied session or ``None``. Bootstrapped if None.
        bronze_filter: ``scope.bronze_filter`` from ``split_run_scope``;
            limits which bronze ids the gate complains about.
        cp_filter: ``scope.cp_filter`` from ``split_run_scope``;
            narrows the silver/gold required-column union.
        resolved_pack: loaded ``ResolvedPack`` or ``None`` (bronze-only
            run — required-column check is skipped).
        tenant_profile: loaded ``TenantProfile`` or ``None``.
        run_id: shared run identifier; threaded into the diagnostic path.
        mode: ``"seed"`` or ``"incremental"`` (carried on the
            ``gate_failed`` RunStep).

    Returns:
        ``None`` when the gate passes (or has nothing to do — empty
        bronze plan, all probes failed and surfaced elsewhere).
        A synthetic :class:`RunStep` with ``status='failed'`` carrying
        AIDPF-2072 when the gate detects drift. The dispatcher consumes
        this and returns a one-step ``RunSummary`` — bronze never runs.

    Notes:
        * The dispatcher-level preflight call is intentionally distinct
          from the legacy bronze path's own preflight inside the
          recursive ``run()``. Both are metadata-only and idempotent;
          the double-probe is wasteful but correct, and lifting the
          preflight result down into the legacy path would require a
          new ``_skip_preflight`` kwarg layered through ``run()``.
          TODO: factor the preflight to a single dispatcher-owned probe and
          skip the duplicate run.
        * A snapshot YAML that's absent OR unparseable degrades the
          gate to missing-column / renamed-column detection only —
          matches the contract in ``fusion_pvo_drift.py``.
        * Failures during preflight itself (BronzeSchemaProbeError,
          credential failures) are NOT caught here — they propagate so
          the operator sees the real probe error, not a synthetic

    Returns ``(prior_plan_hash, prior_watermark_by_source)``.

    Empty result set (no prior successful row exists — the common

    * ``prior_plan_hash=None`` makes the AIDPF-4040 drift gate a no-op

    * Empty ``prior_watermark`` makes the renderer emit
      ``{{ watermark_predicate }}`` as ``1=1`` (correct semantics for
      seed mode AND first incremental — both legitimately have no prior
      cursor).

    Failure modes differ by mode:

    * ``mode == "seed"`` — Spark-side read failures (table missing on
      first run, transient connection blip) are SWALLOWED and the
      function returns ``(None, {})``. Seed semantics are "full
      rebuild from bronze" — no cursor needed; a benign read failure
      shouldn't fail the run.

    * ``mode == "incremental"`` — Spark-side read failures FAIL the
      run with ``StateReadFailedError``. An incremental run cannot
      proceed without verifying the prior cursor + plan hash, because
      falling through to ``(None, {})`` would silently full-scan the
      source AND skip the AIDPF-4040 drift gate. The reviewer's
      example: metastore/permission/schema error on the latest-view
      read would otherwise let the run commit despite being unable to
      verify state.
