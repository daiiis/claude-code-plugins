"""Transient-exception classification + retry-with-backoff helper.

:func:`run_with_retry` retries a thunk on transient infrastructure hiccups
(OCI Object Storage 5xx, Spark executor loss, BICC connection reset) with
exponential backoff, while permanent errors (schema-not-found, auth denied,
Delta merge failures) skip retry entirely and fail fast — so real bugs are
never masked. The classifier (:func:`is_transient`) and backoff loop are
covered by ``tests/integration/test_retry_chaos.py``.

NOTE — not yet wired into the content-pack node loop. The current per-node
runner (``orchestrator/__init__.py`` → ``cp_execute_node``) dispatches each
node directly, WITHOUT this wrapper, so transient failures currently fail the
node rather than being retried. Wrapping ``cp_execute_node`` in
``run_with_retry`` is a tracked follow-up (it changes live extract/MERGE
runtime behavior and needs its own chaos-test validation); until then this
module provides the classifier + helper for callers that opt in, not an
always-on resilience tier. Resume-from-checkpoint (``--resume <run_id>``) is a
separate, live capability in ``orchestrator/resume.py``.

    connection resets) is transient.

    The classifier walks:
