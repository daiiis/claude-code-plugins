description: "Read-only triage router for Oracle AIDP Fusion bundle failures. Use when the user pastes CLI output, a traceback, an `.aidp/diagnostics` path, a run id, or says bootstrap, validate, seed, incremental, dashboard, OAC, or workbook failed. Extract `AIDPF-*` codes, affected run id, dataset, layer, variation point, or diagnostic artifact; explain the failure briefly; route to the correct skill or command such as `/aidp-fusion-config`, `/aidp-fusion-bootstrap`, `/medallion-author`, `/fusion-drift-doctor`, `/aidp-fusion-seed`, `/aidp-fusion-incremental`, `/oac-dataset-setup`, or `/workbook-authoring`. Also triage non-AIDPF OAC MCP disconnect symptoms. Never run destructive seed, never edit profiles or overlays, and never bypass drift gates."

# aidpf-error-triage - route failures to the right recovery path

This skill is the read-only front door for failures. It turns pasted errors,
diagnostic artifacts, and failed-run summaries into a safe next step.

It does not fix anything itself. It identifies the failure class, names the
evidence, and routes to the skill or CLI command that owns the recovery.

## When to use

- User pastes output containing `AIDPF-*`.
- User gives `.aidp/diagnostics/<run_id>/...` or a run id.
- User says `validate`, `bootstrap`, `seed`, `incremental`, `dashboard`, OAC,
  dataset setup, or workbook authoring failed.
- User asks "what should I do with this error?"
- Autopilot hits an error and needs to route without guessing.

## When NOT to use

- Clean first-run setup with no failure -> `/aidp-fusion-autopilot`.
- Known single action with no error, such as "run seed" -> use that skill.
- Authoring new marts -> `/mart-author`.
- Creating workbooks from a verified dataset -> `/workbook-authoring`.
- Full error-code reference browsing -> read `docs/aidpf-error-codes.md`.

## Inputs to collect

Collect what is available, but do not block on everything:

- exact pasted error output,
- command that failed,
- active phase: validate, bootstrap, seed, incremental, dashboard, OAC dataset, workbook,
- run id,
- dataset/node id,
- layer,
- diagnostic artifact path or `.aidp/diagnostics/<run_id>/` directory,
- whether this is dev/sandbox or production.

Never ask the user to paste passwords, OAuth tokens, private keys, full OCIDs,
or full OAC connection payloads.

## Workflow

### 1. Extract the failure signal

Search the pasted text and any artifact paths for codes:

```text
AIDPF-\d{4}
```

If the user gives a diagnostics directory, list the files:

```bash
find .aidp/diagnostics/<run_id> -maxdepth 1 -type f -print
```

If the user gives a diagnostic JSON file, read it and extract:

- `errorCode`,
- `runId`,
- `tenant`,
- `datasetId` or `node`,
- `layer`,
- variation point name,
- missing columns,
- observed/live schema fields,
- companion logs such as `cluster_stdout.log`.

If multiple codes appear, triage in this order:

1. Fatal active code tied to the command's exit.
2. Diagnostic artifact code.
3. Runtime drift/gate code.
4. Pack validation aggregate such as `AIDPF-1036`, then its nested per-error code.
5. Historical or test-only code only if no active code exists.

If there is no `AIDPF-*` code, classify by symptom:

- OAC MCP server missing, disconnected, unauthenticated, or no tools -> run
  project-scoped `dashboard mcp-setup` plus resume checkpoint.
- `CredentialResolutionError` or missing Fusion password -> fix AIDP credential store / `aidp.config.yaml` secret names.
- `ResumeRunNotFoundError`, `ResumeRunNotResumableError`, or `ResumeBundleMismatchError` -> resume-specific guidance.
- Unknown traceback -> ask for the command and nearest error lines; do not guess a destructive fix.

### 2. Route by code family

Use this table for the first response. Keep it short, then include evidence and
the next command/skill.

| Code family | Meaning | Route |
|---|---|---|
| `AIDPF-1020` | Bootstrap operator identity missing. | Re-run `/aidp-fusion-bootstrap` with `--operator` or set `AIDP_OPERATOR` / `USER`. |
| `AIDPF-1030`, `1031`, `1033` | Missing content-pack profile or contentPack block. | Fix `bundle.yaml`; run `/aidp-fusion-bootstrap`. |
| `AIDPF-1034`, `1042`, `1043`, `1045`, `2081` | Invalid dataset/layer/scope or bundle node id. | Fix scope, use `content-pack info`, or `use-pack`; do not seed guessed nodes. |
| `AIDPF-1036`, `2000` to `2004`, `2030`, `2040`, `2041` | Pack or overlay validation failure. | Fix YAML/SQL/schema issue; if from a new mart overlay, return to `/mart-author`. |
| `AIDPF-2010`, `2011` | Bootstrap variation point unresolved. | `/medallion-author` with the diagnostic artifact, then bootstrap refresh. |
| `AIDPF-2012` | Bronze fingerprint drift from pinned profile. | `/fusion-drift-doctor` or `/aidp-fusion-bootstrap --refresh` after confirming drift is intended. |
| `AIDPF-2042`, `2043`, `2044`, `2046`, `2072`, `4070`, `4071` | Source, PVO, or runtime schema drift/gate. | `/fusion-drift-doctor`; it may route to bootstrap refresh, `/medallion-author`, or investigate. |
| `AIDPF-2047`, `2048`, `2049` | Cluster bootstrap dispatch/probe failure. | `/aidp-fusion-bootstrap`; inspect diagnostic JSON and `cluster_stdout.log` if present. |
| `AIDPF-2071` | Bronze readiness failed for silver/gold. | Seed/repair required bronze through `/aidp-fusion-seed`; do not run mart-only refresh until bronze exists. |
| `AIDPF-2092` | Bronze cursor and target/state mismatch. | Repair state/target alignment; usually inspect status before incremental. |
| `AIDPF-4040` | Plan-hash drift on resume/incremental. | `/fusion-drift-doctor`; if intentional, scoped re-seed changed node or documented repin in dev only. |
| `AIDPF-4060`, `4061` | State commit or watermark regression. | Stop; inspect state-table write/order issue before retrying. |
| `AIDPF-5001`, `5002`, `5010`, `5011`, `5013`, `5014` | SQL renderer or builtin dispatch issue. | Fix SQL/template/profile value; route to `/mart-author` if a new overlay caused it. |
| `AIDPF-5003` | Variation point unresolved during rendering. | `/aidp-fusion-bootstrap`; if candidate missing, `/medallion-author`. |
| `AIDPF-7001` to `7005`, `8002` | Dashboard validation/security issue. | Fix dashboard descriptor or workbook requirements; remove high-PII exposure. |
| `AIDPF-8010`, `8011` | Quality test failed or unsupported. | Inspect failed quality rule; fix data/node logic or accept deferred rule intentionally. |
| `AIDPF-9999` | Test-only invalid code. | Treat as malformed diagnostics outside tests. |

For codes not listed here, consult `docs/aidpf-error-codes.md` and state that
the route is based on the reference table.

### 3. Read diagnostics when available

When the route names a downstream skill, pass concrete artifacts:

```text
run id:
diagnostic file:
dataset/node:
layer:
variation point:
missing columns:
next skill:
```

Examples:

- `AIDPF-2010__invoice_currency_code.json` -> `/medallion-author`.
- `AIDPF-2072.json` or `AIDPF-4071__<node>.json` -> `/fusion-drift-doctor`.
- `AIDPF-2048.json` plus `cluster_stdout.log` -> `/aidp-fusion-bootstrap`.

Do not synthesize missing diagnostic context. If an expected artifact is absent,
say what file is needed or ask for the command output.

### 4. Produce the triage response

Use this format:

```text
code: AIDPF-2072
phase: incremental
meaning: live Fusion PVO schema drifted from the pinned profile
evidence: .aidp/diagnostics/<run_id>/AIDPF-2072.json
route: /fusion-drift-doctor
next: diagnose live PVO drift; likely bootstrap --refresh or /medallion-author
do not: bypass drift gates or run destructive seed
```

For OAC MCP disconnect with no AIDPF code:

```text
code: none
phase: OAC MCP
meaning: MCP connection is unavailable; this is not proof that datasets are absent
route: from the customer project directory run:
  env -u OAC_URL -u OAC_MCP_USER -u OAC_MCP_PASSWORD -u OAC_ADMIN_USER -u OAC_ADMIN_PASSWORD \
  aidp-fusion-bundle dashboard mcp-setup --connector-js <path>
  then write .aidp/autopilot/resume.md and reconnect Claude Code
next: resume from .aidp/autopilot/resume.md and re-probe OAC
```

### 5. Guardrails

- Stay read-only. Do not edit files, run bootstrap, seed, incremental, or
  workbook save from this skill.
- Never recommend destructive seed as the first recovery unless the owner skill
  has proven it is the right fix and the user confirms.
- Never recommend `--force-fingerprint-skip` outside dev/break-glass.
- Never hand-write `profiles/` or `evidence/`.
- Never route `AIDPF-2010` / `AIDPF-2011` to `/mart-author`; use `/medallion-author`.
- Never treat disconnected OAC MCP as an empty OAC catalog.
- Always name the downstream skill or command and the evidence it should read.

## Skill family

- Front door for failures from `/aidp-fusion-autopilot`.
- Routes config gaps to `/aidp-fusion-config`.
- Routes bootstrap/profile issues to `/aidp-fusion-bootstrap`.
- Routes tenant variation gaps to `/medallion-author`.
- Routes runtime drift gates to `/fusion-drift-doctor`.
- Routes run-mode work to `/aidp-fusion-seed` or `/aidp-fusion-incremental`.
- Routes OAC dataset/workbook issues to `/oac-dataset-setup` or `/workbook-authoring`.
