"""Resume helpers — pure functions used when ``--resume`` is set.

Three pure functions used by ``orchestrator.run`` when ``--resume`` is set:

  * :func:`reconstruct_resume_scope` — derive the ``datasets`` / ``layers``
    filter from the stored ``plan_snapshot`` so bare ``--resume <run_id>``
    (no CLI filters) re-resolves the original scope.
  * :func:`render_drift_error` — produce the operator-facing
    ``ResumeBundleMismatchError`` message: identity diff first, dataset
    diff second, hash echo last.
  * :func:`compute_reattempt_extra_deps` — augment external-dep preflight
    so reattempted downstream nodes catch a manually-dropped upstream
    table BEFORE dispatch (clean exit-2, not a mid-flight crash).

These live in a dedicated module to keep ``orchestrator/__init__.py``
focused on the main dispatch loop. They are pure (no Spark, no I/O) so
unit-testable without fixtures.

      2. **Dataset diff** — added / removed dataset_ids, and for nodes
         present on both sides with diverging
         ``(layer, mode, effective_schema)``, name the per-field delta.

    catches the (unlikely) case where the canonical-payload code path
    differs from the hash compute path (would manifest as "hash mismatch
