"""Shared `IncrementalImpact` Pydantic model.

Lives here rather than in :mod:`evidence_snapshot` or
:mod:`medallion_pack` because BOTH modules need to reference it:

* :class:`schema.evidence_snapshot.ResolvedVariationPoint` carries an
  optional ``incremental_impact`` field that bootstrap populates on
  ``--refresh`` commit (and on initial commit when the overlay is
  skill-authored).
* :class:`schema.medallion_pack.PackProvenance` carries an optional
  ``incremental_impact`` map (per-VP) so the medallion-author skill
  can record the impact analysis in the overlay it drafts. Bootstrap
  reads from there at commit time.

Defining the model here keeps the import direction
``evidence_snapshot.py → incremental_impact.py`` and ``medallion_pack.py
→ incremental_impact.py`` — no circular dependency.

Schema version 1 is **additive-only** going forward per the
forward-compat rule.
