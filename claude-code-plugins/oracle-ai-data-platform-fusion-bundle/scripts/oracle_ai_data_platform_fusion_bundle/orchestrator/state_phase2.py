"""Content-pack state-layer additions: additive migration + atomic batch write.

This module sits alongside ``orchestrator/state.py`` and adds:

* :data:`CONTENT_PACK_STATE_COLUMNS` — the tuple of nullable columns added
  to ``fusion_bundle_state`` for content-pack runs.
* :func:`ensure_state_columns_v2` — additive migration using the same
  introspect-then-ADD COLUMNS pattern v1 uses (Spark rejects ``ADD
  COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS``; we DESCRIBE first, compute the missing set,
  emit a single ALTER).
* :func:`update_latest_view_for_phase2` — redeploys the ``fusion_bundle_state_latest``
  view with the widened partition ``(run_id, dataset_id, layer, source_id)``.
  v1 rows project identically in the common single-layer-dataset_id
  case; multi-layer dataset_id (rare; v1 collapsed them — that was a
  latent bug) now correctly returns one row per layer.
* :class:`StateCommitError` — raised on a hard-write failure.
* :func:`write_state_rows_hard` — **atomic batch** write. Builds one
  DataFrame from ``rows`` and appends it to the state table in a
  single Delta append. Delta's append atomicity guarantees all rows
  commit together or none do, so a multi-source success cannot
  partially commit (which would advance the primary's
  output_watermark without the lookup audit rows reaching the table).

The base ``ensure_state_table`` and ``write_state_row`` continue to work
unchanged. Content-pack callers explicitly invoke these helpers.
