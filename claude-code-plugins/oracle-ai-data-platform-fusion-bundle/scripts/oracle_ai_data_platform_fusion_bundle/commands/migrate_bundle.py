"""Implementation of ``aidp-fusion-bundle migrate-bundle --from X --to Y``.

Today no migrations are registered — the only supported version is `"0.2.0"`.
When v0.3 ships with a breaking schema change, the migrator gains a
real implementation here and the CLI surface stays stable.

**Returns exit codes directly** — does NOT raise NotImplementedError
because this is a separate top-level CLI verb and must produce its own exit
codes.
